# Use the upstream Redis Memory Server Dockerfile
# This is just a placeholder as we're building from the GitHub repo directly
# See docker-compose.yml for the actual build context

# If you need to customize the build:
# FROM ghcr.io/redis-developer/agent-memory-server:latest
# ADD your-customizations /app/
